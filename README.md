# Transformers-from-Scratch
## 1_ Covers Encoder part of original transformer,implemented using tensorflow 
            . Include Embeddings+Positional Encoding 
            . Self-Attention, Multihead-Attention
            . FCN, Layer Normalizations and Residual Connection with dropouts regularization
            . Sigmoid for classfication in final layer

## 2_ Sequence to Sequence Transformer for Neural Machine Translation 
            . Complete Encoder Decoder Architecture
            . Cross Attention
            . Mask Multi Head Attention
            . Softmax
